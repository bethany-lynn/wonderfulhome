                    Founded in 2015 by the dynamic duo, Jim and Angela, The Wonderful Home is not just a 
                    business—it's a labor of love that spans nearly four decades. With a shared passion for homes, 
                    a commitment to helping others, and a vision to infuse love and comfort into every space, Jim and 
                    Angela have become synonymous with creating living environments that truly feel like home.  
                    As a team for almost 40 years, and a professional team for 10, Jim and Angela bring a wealth of experience 
                    and a deep understanding 
                    of the importance of family. Family is not only at the center of their inspiration but also an integral 
                    part of their lives. Their commitment to creating homes that inspire love and comfort is a reflection of 
                    their own values and the cherished moments they've shared as a family.

                    Jim and Angela's love extends beyond their craft and spills into their home, where they share their 
                    lives with their beloved little doggy, Ethel. With two daughters and a collection of past pets 
                    that hold a special place in their hearts, The Wonderful Home is a testament to the warmth, joy, 
                    and love that family brings.
                    At The Wonderful Home, we invite you to be a part of our journey—a journey fueled by passion, 
                    inspired by family, and dedicated to making your home a place where love and comfort thrive.
